			<h3>Asset Nalhoc's Account</h3>
			<blockquote><p>I remember it like it was yesterday. I was driving up Highway 49 when a strange feeling washed over me. It was as if, somehow, my body knew about the coming events. Against my better judgment I slowed down, my hands gripped firmly to the steering wheel. That’s when I saw it.</p>
			
			<p>The glistening afternoon sun was setting behind stained plastic, turning the normally brown hues of the Jug into a spectrum of orange, copper, and gold. At first I wasn’t sure if what I was seeing was real.</p>
				<p>After what simultaneously felt like an eternity and a few moments, I was brought back to earth by the sound of car horns. In my trance, I merged into the other lane, nearly colliding with oncoming traffic. I quickly snapped back to reality and gained control of my vehicle. I drove, my shaking hands gripping the steering wheel. I  dare not try to pull over.</p>
			
			<p>Only two hours later did I gain the courage to stop on the side of a road. I fell out of the car Beneath me I felt the powdery dust and dirt left behind by the waning summer.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, everything I was holding inside of me since the encounter escaped my shallow frame. My sobs echoed through the valley, bouncing back as if to taunt me. I can’t tell you how long I stayed there, but when I was finally able to calm my breathing, I climbed back inside the metal frame of my car and drove myself home.</p>
			<p>To this day I often reflect on the jug&hellip; but never for too long. It’s important to keep moving; I was lucky to walk away from that experience. I’ve vowed never to let the Jug have that kind of control over me again.</p></blockquote>
